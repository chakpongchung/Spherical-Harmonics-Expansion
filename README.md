spherical harmonics expansion and the general solution of the scalar product of rotational gradient operator.
========================================================================


TUTORIAL
--------


http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chakpongchung/spherical-harmonics-expansion/blob/master/Master-Project.ipynb


USE CASES:
----------

One of the use cases we find is in nematic polymer simulation. We used it to find out the parameters that can coverge to  periodic pattern for 1D sturcture.

The core algorithm is now implemented with Boost C++ Libraries and GNU Scientific Library(GSL) in C/C++. It can also be used with SymPy in Python since SciPy 2015.

The relevant notations used and derivatiosns are attaced in the corresponding folders here.


To use the code-snippets in linux, you can run it in the terminal with

    code-snippets$ bash ./run.sh


To test, go to the src folder and:

    src$ make
