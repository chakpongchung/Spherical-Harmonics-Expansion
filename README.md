 We used it in nematic polymer simulation to find out the parameters that can coverge to  periodic pattern.



The core algorithm is implemented with Boost C++ Libraries and GNU Scientific Library(GSL) in C/C++. It can also be used with SymPy in Python since SciPy 2015.

To get started, you can run the following commands:

    tests$ bash ./run.sh



LIBRARIES DEPENDENCIES:
-----------------------
Updates:  
starting from c++17, Associated Legendre Polynomials(hence the function for Spherical Harmonics) are supported in C++17  .
