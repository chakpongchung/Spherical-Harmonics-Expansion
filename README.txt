This is a project for spherical harmonics expansion and the general solution of the inner product of rotational gradient operator.

The core algorithm is now implemented with boost and GNU scientific library in C/C++ and SymPy in python.

The relevant notations used and derivatiosn are attaced as pdf files named "derivation.pdf" and "dot_product.pdf".A corresponding detailed ipython notebook will be uploaded once finished

To use it in linux, you can run it in the terminal with

#source compile.txt


LIBRARIES PREQUISITE:

Boost C++ Libraries 
www.boost.org/
GSL - GNU Scientific Library - GNU Project
www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
SymPy
http://www.sympy.org/


So far I have not find a way to compile the GSL on Windows machine with Visual Studio.Please send email to chakpongchung@gmail.com
should you encounter any trouble using the code.
